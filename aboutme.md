I am a software engineer with a specialization in data engineering. I am primarily self trained and have been working towards this career for close to ten years. In that time I've built command line tools in C and C++, iOS apps and tools, and more. I have spent most of the last year studying Data Science at Lambda School and have the most experience building tools and analyzing data in Python 3. I am a strong advocate for pair programming and collaborative problem solving. 


Proffesionally my background is in tech support and training. I love working with people to solve problems using technology. I have extensive remote working experience using Zoom and Slack, and have lead classes using GoToWebinar. I love teaching and would love a position where I get to share my knowledge with others.
